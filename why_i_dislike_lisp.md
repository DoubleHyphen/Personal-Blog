![For me, it's olives. For you it's probably something else:
A long time ago: “Yuck. Olives taste bad.”
A year later: “Maybe black olives taste better—Nope, gross…”
A year later: “I'll bet they taste good on pizza—Ugh, does anyone want this slice?”
A year later: “I wonder why I hate the taste of olives—Yup, I remember now…”
A year later: “I bet I was just fussy when I was younger—Nevermind, sick…”
A year later: “I won't let such a small thing defeat me like this—Changed my mind, I give up…”
